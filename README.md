# VisibleTheme


### Possibilities!
There can be "Black" symbols or text when using this theme other <br>
then HTML, CSS, LESS or JAVASCRIPT.

In that case, please provide a little script where the "Black"
symbols or text are visible <br> 
in the correct extention for example in python, php, C#, C++ etc.

I got none to very low knowledge of those language.
If it happend to find one, let me know.
